## Case studies

### My SaaS Experience – Predefined Packages Module on Juniper Booking Engine

This project highlighted a common but critical challenge in SaaS implementation: balancing standard functionality with the need for business-specific innovation. The Juniper Predefined Packages module, like many SaaS products, offered strong baseline capabilities but had limited flexibility for deep customization. Our project required unique logic and user flows that exceeded the vendor's willingness or ability to support under their standard roadmap.
